First of all it is obvious that the question is about a tree.Because it has no cycle. Theoretically, it is proved for ann-vertex graph that it is not possible to contain a cycle andhave less than n nodes. In addition, according to theassumption all of the nodes have to be connected, itmeans the graph has connectivity. Consequently, this is atree.

My java program contains a class and two methods. Oneof the methods is the main method that gets inputs andsaves the tree(saves in 2D boolean array). After thatanother method will be called. All the logic of the programexists in this method.

The operations start with the first node and it continues tothe last one. It has two nested loops to access two nodes.The initial loop is responsible for the index of the secondnode and the other loop response to index first node. If theedge exists, the first node will be the second and thesecond one will start from the first node in the graph. Itcontinues until a leaf is found, and then the leaf will beremoved and the counter will be 0; though the counter wasmore than maxWay, maxWay catches the counter amountand then counter will be 0.




<a name="br2"></a>This way is used till the first node becomes the last. Noneed to compute this state because definitely in otherstates opposite of this way has been computed. Thuswhen the first node is the last one, the method returns themaxWay amount and it is printed in the terminal.

● After removing all edges, the starting tree will be replaced by the current tree.

● When the first and second nodes form an edge, one is added to the amount of counter.

● When the second node becomes the first, the first node cannot become the second, otherwise this operation will not be finished.

● There are always at least two leaves. For this reason

we don't fall in an infinite loop.

Code:

This is the main method. I use an adjacency matrix to save thetree. Because of that, when the (m, n) is true, the (n, m) has to betrue.




<a name="br3"></a>In the *findTheLongestWay* method I definedanother 2D boolean array and I put all values of the mainarray in it. I did it because the array has a reference inmemory.

I defined a variable named “temp”. It should keep the oldvalue of the first node, And doesnt let the second node tobe equal to itself.

If all elements of the newGraph become false, it takes thevalues of the graph again.

I hope the explanation is useful.
